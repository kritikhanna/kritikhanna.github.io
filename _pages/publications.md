<b> Job Market Paper: </b> Credit Contract Enforcement and Income Disparities across Indian States: A Heterogeneous Agents Framewrk with Formal and Informal Firms

<b> Abstract </b>  Effective enforcement of credit contracts and the legal protection of investors is associated with an efficient allocation of capital and entrepreneurial skills across production units in an economy, leading to increased aggregate productivity and output per capita. My paper evaluates quantitatively the role of efficiency in enforcement of credit contracts in explaining the income per capita disparities across Indian States.  I calibrate for each state a dynamic, infinite horizon, heterogeneous agents, 3-occupational types, general equilibrium model with credit contract enforcement related borrowing frictions and heterogeneous formal and informal firms. In the model, state-specific ability to enforce these contracts, as measured by speed of clearing of cases by state courts, impacts collateral requirements for individuals, the potential size of firms they can run and profits they can earn, and hence their occupational choices and contribution to the GDP. Exploiting the variation in implementation of a judicial reforms policy across Indian states in 2002, I empirically identify the causal impact of judicial efficiency on occupational choices of individuals, showing that our structural model mechanisms are grounded in strong empirics.
