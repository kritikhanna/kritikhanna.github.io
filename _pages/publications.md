<b> Abstract: </b> This paper evaluates the role of enforcement of credit contracts in explaining the income per capita disparities across Indian states using a dynamic heterogeneous-agents general equilibrium framework with occupational choices. First, I estimate the impact of credit contract enforcement on occupational choices of the working population in India by exploiting the variation in the implementation of a judicial reforms policy across Indian states in 2002. Then, I develop and calibrate for each state a heterogeneous-agents model with state-specific endogenous borrowing constraints and a distinction between formal and informal firm types. In the model, the state-specific ability to enforce credit contracts, as measured by the speed by which state courts clear civil cases, affects individual's borrowing ability, the potential size of firms they can run, and the profits they can earn. Additionally, given the labor market frictions and the ability to self-finance, individuals sort into different occupational types. Overall, improved enforcement of credit contracts reduces the misallocation of factors of production---entrepreneurial skills, capital, and labor across production units---leading to increased aggregate productivity and output per capita of an economy.
