<b> Job Market Paper: </b> Credit Contract Enforcement and Income Disparities across Indian States: A Heterogeneous Agents Framework with Formal and Informal Firms

<b> Abstract: </b>  Effective enforcement of credit contracts and the legal protection of investors is associated with an efficient allocation of capital and entrepreneurial skills across production units, leading to increased aggregate productivity and output per capita of an economy. My paper evaluates quantitatively the role of efficiency in enforcement of credit contracts in explaining the income per capita disparities across Indian States.  I calibrate for each state a dynamic, infinite horizon, heterogeneous agents, 3-occupational types, general equilibrium model with credit contract enforcement related borrowing frictions and heterogeneous formal and informal firms. In the model, state-specific ability to enforce these contracts, as measured by speed of clearing of cases by state courts, impacts collateral requirements for individuals, the potential size of firms they can run and profits they can earn, and further their occupational choices, savings and contribution to GDP. Exploiting the variation in implementation of a judicial reforms policy across Indian states in 2002, I empirically identify the causal impact of contract enforcement on occupational choices of individuals, indicating that my structural model mechanisms are grounded in strong empirics.
