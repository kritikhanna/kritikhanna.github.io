Hi! Welcome to my website.  <br />  <br /> 
My name is Kriti Khanna, I am a _Founding Faculty, Assistant professor_ in Economics, at Plaksha University, Mohali, India. I have also served as the _Founding_ _Program Chair_ of the Data Science, Economics, and Business Program at Plaksha University between April 2022- Aug 2023.  <br /> 

My research investigates how institutional frictions and policy forces shape productivity, firm dynamics, and structural transformation in emerging economies, with a primary focus on India. My work analyzes how weak credit enforcement, labor regulations, and targeted industrial policies—such as India’s Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes—distort resource allocation and aggregate performance. Methodologically, I combine dynamic heterogeneous-agent macroeconomic models with causal empirical strategies using firm- and household-level data. <br /> 

Prior to this, I earned my Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Houston. <br /> 

At Plaksha University, I teach courses in macroeconomics theory, macro-development, and applied econometrics. I’m especially passionate about mentoring students and building research capacity in fast-growing academic ecosystems.
