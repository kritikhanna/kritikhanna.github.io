Hi! Welcome to my website.  <br />  <br /> 
My name is Kriti Khanna, and I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at the University of Houston. My research interests are in the fields of Macroeconomics, Development and Entrepreneurship. <br /> <br /> 
My job market paper focuses on evaluating the role of credit contract enforcement in explaining the income per capita disparities across Indian States. I use a dynamic, hetergeneous agents, general equilibrium framework with formal and informal firms in which credit contract enforcement impacts the ability to borrow of individuals, further their  occupational choices and contribution to GDP. In a discrete occupational choice empirical exercise, I verify that my structural model mechanisms are grounded in strong empirics. <br /> <br />
