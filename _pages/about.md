Hi! Welcome to my website.  <br />  <br /> 
My name is Kriti Khanna, I am a Founding Faculty, Assistant professor in Economics at Plaksha University, Mohali. My research interests are in the fields of Macroeconomics, Development, and Entrepreneurship. <br /> <br /> 
In my recent paper, I evaluate the role of credit contract enforcement in creating the income per capita disparities across Indian States. I employ a dynamic heterogeneous-agents general-equilibrium framework with formal and informal firms for my analysis. In a discrete choice empirical exercise to motivate the model mechanisms, I study the causal implications of credit contract enforcement on the occupational choices of the working population in India. <br /> <br /> 
I was a recipient of the 'Dr. Walter J. Primeaux Jr. and Natalie A. Primeaux Scholarship' awarded to the most promising researcher completing his/her 4th year of Ph.D at the University of Houston.<br /> <br /> 
I am currently the Program Coordinator of the Data Science, Economics, and Business Program at Plaksha University.  <br />
