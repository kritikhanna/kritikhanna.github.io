Hi!  <br /> 
Welcome to my website. My name is Kriti Khanna, and I am currently a PhD Candidate in Economics at the University of Houston. My research interests are in the fields of Macroeconomics, Development and Entrepreneurship. <br /> 
My job market paper focuses on evaluating the role of Credit Contract Enforcement on income disparities across Indian States. I use a dynamic, hetergeneous agents framework with formal and informal firms, in which contract enforcement impacts the ability to borrow and futher the choice of occupations of individuals.
