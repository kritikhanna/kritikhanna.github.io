Hi! Welcome to my website.  <br />  <br /> 
My name is Kriti Khanna, I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at the University of Houston. My research interests are in the fields of Macroeconomics, Development and Entrepreneurship. <br /> <br /> 
My job market paper focuses on evaluating the role of credit contract enforcement in explaining the income per capita disparities across Indian States. I use a dynamic, heterogeneous agents, general equilibrium framework with formal and informal firms in which credit contract enforcement impacts the borrowing ability of individuals, further their occupational choices and contribution to the GDP. In a discrete choice empirical exercise, I analyse the causal implications of credit contract enforcement on occupational choice of individuals. <br /> <br /> 
I am a recipient of the 'Dr. Walter J. Primeaux Jr. and Natalie A. Primeaux Scholarship' awarded to the most promising researcher completing his/her 4th year of Ph.D.  <br /> 
I am going to be on the job market this year.
